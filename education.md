### Co-Lin Community College (2009 - 2011)
- Computer Science A.A. (Incomplete, Transferred), 4.0 GPA

I began my education at a small community college located in Wesson, Mississippi. I enrolled in the Computer Science program in order to obtain an Associates Degree. During my brief time there, I achieved several things. An essay I wrote titled ”Robotic Automation and the Future Economy” took 3rd place in a school wide competition and was published in the [school's yearly periodical]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/microcosm_2011.pdf). I also received the Beal Family Scholarship which is awarded to the Computer Science student with the highest GPA. 

I did not complete the Associates Degree. I maintained a 4.0 GPA, but I decided to transfer to the University of Southern Mississippi to pursue a Bachelors Degree.

### University of Southern Mississippi (2011 - 2014)
- Computer Science B.S., _summa cum laude_, 4.0 GPA

I transferred to the University of Southern Mississippi, located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in 2011. I transferred into the School of Computing's Computer Science program. During my undergraduate time I was selected for a summer apprenticeship with one of the professors under the U.S. Army Research Office's Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP). More info on my participation in the URAP program can be found under [work experience]({{ site.baseurl }}/work). I also applied to be involved in the honors program. In order to graduate with the Latin designation, we were required to do an undergraduate thesis. Info on my undergraduate thesis can be found on the [project page here]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link _posts/2014-04-24-undergraduate-thesis.md %}).

I completed my Bachelors Degree with a 4.0 GPA and received the Latin honors designation of _summa cum laude_.

### University of Southern Mississippi (2014 - 2015)
- Computer Science M.S., 4.0 GPA

After obtaining my Bachelors Degree, I continued at the University of Southern Mississippi to work on a Masters Degree. During this time, there were two extracurricular accomplishments that stood out. 

The first is the publication of a project my advisor and I had worked on during the end of my previous degree. The project was published in the section "Model AI Assignments 2014" in the conference journal for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2014. The abstracts for that section can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/papers/model_ai_abstracts.pdf). The project was designed as a class exercise to implement a Strimko solver program to be used as an undergraduate AI assignment. More info on this project can be found under the [Strimko Solver project page]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link _posts/2014-07-27-project-strimko.md %}). 

The second accomplishment was a 3D printing fundraiser for the [School of Computing Graduate School Association](https://www.usm.edu/computing/graduate-student-association). There were two parts to this event. For the first part, we sold various 3D printed items for various prices. For the second part of the event, we used a Microsoft Kinect to scan people and 3D print figures of them. More information on this can be found on the b [3D print fundraiser project page.]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link _posts/2016-04-11-project-3d-printing.md %})

I completed my Masters Degree with a 4.0 GPA.

### University of Southern Mississippi (2015 - 2017)
- Computational Science Ph.D. (Incomplete), 4.0 GPA

After finishing my Masters Degree, I decided to continue into the PhD program at the University of Southern Mississippi. During this time, there were two extracuricular accomplishments that stood out. The first was the third publication I was involved in titled [”Detection of Plan Deviation in Multi-Agent Systems”]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/deviation_detection.pdf) which was published in the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2016 conference journal. The second was being able to travel to and attend the conference where the paper was shown as a poster presentation. 

I completed five semesters before deciding to withdraw and pursue employment. At the time of withdrawal, I had a 4.0 GPA.
