### About Me

My name is Lucas Thompson. I am currently located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi where I recently worked and studied at the University of Southern Mississippi. I have decided to leave academia, and I am currently seeking employment in my field.

I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2014 with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and 4.0 GPA. I continued on to obtain a Masters Degree with a 4.0 GPA in Computer Science in 2015, and I began the pursuit of a Ph.D. in Computational Science. After five semesters in the Ph.D. program, I decided to leave and pursue employment. Previous to obtaining my degrees, I spent eight years working in construction, welding, and metal fabrication.

I worked as a research assistant during my undergraduate and graduate years. My work was focused on artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and applying various other machine learning algorithms to robotics problems. Some of my variety of tasks included setting up simulations, gathering and analyzing data to create data sets, and assisting in the creation and instruction of a new introductory robotics course. I developed many skills over this time. The foremost being the ability to do research and apply critical thinking to complex problems. I also developed other skills during my studies including, but not limited to, software development, web design, mobile development, and technical writing.

I am not seeking a position working with robotics. I was provided the opportunity to pay for my graduate degree by working as a research assistant that mostly focused in robotics. However, robotics is not my primary interest. I am currently seeking to further my experience in machine learning and data science. I look forward to working in an environment focused on interesting problems and challenging opportunities.
