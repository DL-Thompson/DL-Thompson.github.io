This is the third assignment for my COS702 Data Analysis Techniques. The course had a large focus on radial basis functions and interpolating missing data.

In this assignment, we used a small 3D point cloud to construct a 3D surface over the cloud. Since the cloud was small, we tried to interpolate extra data to construct the surface.
