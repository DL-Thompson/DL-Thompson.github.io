title: COS702 - Assignment 6

This is the sixth assignment for my COS702 Data Analysis Techniques. The course had a large focus on radial basis functions and interpolating missing data.

In the previous assignments, normal vectors were required for the computations, and they were provided. In this assignment, no normal vectors were provided. We were to do research on various normal vector estimation techniques and test them out. We were also told to use one old data set and find a new data set of our own choosing. This assignment happened to fall around the time of the [3D printing fundrasier]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link _posts/2016-04-11-project-3d-printing.md %}) that I took part in. I decided to generate the point cloud for my new data set using the STL file of my 3D scan.
