This is the first assignment for my COS702 Data Analysis Techniques. The course had a large focus on radial basis functions and interpolating missing data.

In the first assignment, we were to reconstruct the 3D plot of the Peaks function using a randomly generated sparse data set. To fill in the missing data, multiple radial basis functions were used and compared. The assignment is below.
