This is the bonus assignment for my COS702 Data Analysis Techniques. The course had a large focus on radial basis functions and interpolating missing data.

This isn't technically an assignment, but I figured I would post it. The instructor allowed us to do a bonus assignment for extra credit, and he left it free for us to choose the topic. One class during the semester, the instructor mentioned that he was always on the lookout for 3D point cloud data sets because he had a limited collection. Since I had used STL files in [Assignment 6]({{ site.baseurl }} {% link _posts/2016-05-12-COS702-Assignment-6.md %}) to create 3D point clouds, I decided I would submit a tutorial on creating 3D point clouds from STL files as my bonus assignment. It covered everything from where to get the files to how to construct them.
